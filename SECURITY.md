# Security policy

If you discover a security issue, please open an issue and include steps to reproduce. For sensitive vulnerabilities, contact the maintainers directly or use the repository's private vulnerability disclosure mechanism.

This project uses an `apply` rotator that can modify files; do not run `apply` on production data without backups and verification (use `--dry-run` first and `--force` explicitly to confirm).
